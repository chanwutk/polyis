"""Worker pool spawners with fan-out / fan-in relay threads.

Multi-consumer queues break the simple ``None`` shutdown sentinel pattern:
only one consumer ever sees the single ``None``, leaving the rest blocked.
We solve this with two small relay threads per pool:

- **fan-out relay**: reads from the upstream queue, forwards messages to
  the pool's internal input queue, and on ``None`` broadcasts ``N`` ``None``
  sentinels (one per worker).
- **fan-in relay**: reads from the pool's internal output queue, forwards
  messages to the downstream queue, counts ``N`` ``None`` sentinels (one
  per worker), then sends a single ``None`` downstream.

The result is that callers of :func:`spawn_pool` see a clean
single-producer-single-consumer interface from the outside.
