"""Ablation condition definitions for incremental optimization evaluation.

Defines parameter-space restrictions that produce separate Pareto curves per
dataset, each representing the system with one or more optimizations disabled.
Both p135 (Pareto extraction) and p201 (comparison visualization) import
these definitions so the ablation logic stays in one place.
